# Opensea Clone

This is a small project that I coded and deployed purely to learn the upcoming technology of web3 & sanity.io.

You can head to the [vercel build](https://opensea-clone-johnnykodes.vercel.app/) of the project to see it first hand. Do note that a Metamask account is required to access the website.
